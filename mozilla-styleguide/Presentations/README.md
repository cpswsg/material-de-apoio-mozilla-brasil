# Mozilla Style Guide - Presentations #

Based on our Sandstone website style, our presentation templates are clean, minimalist and light. You can mix and match colors from various templates to make your presentations more dynamic. Title screens can be all text, logo only or a mix of both. Please note that all text throughout your presentations should be set in Open Sans (included in download).
