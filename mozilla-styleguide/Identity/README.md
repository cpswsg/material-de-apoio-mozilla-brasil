#  Mozilla Style Guide - Branding #

## Guidelines

For all permitted uses of our trademarks, you may not:

* alter our logos in any way
* place a logo in such close proximity to other content that it is indistinguishable
* make our logo the most distinctive or prominent feature on your website, printed material or other content
* use our logos in a way that suggests any type of association or partnership with Mozilla or approval, sponsorship or endorsement by Mozilla (unless allowed via a license from us)
* use our logos in a way that is harmful, deceptive, obscene or otherwise objectionable to the average person
* use our logos on websites or other places containing content associated with hate speech, pornography, gambling or illegal activities
* use our logos to, or in connection with, content that disparages us or sullies our reputation

## Wordmark

The standard Mozilla wordmark is set in Meta Bold. Please download one of the file formats to the right if you need to use it rather than typing and setting it yourself.

You can use any solid color for the Mozilla wordmark. Which color you choose depends on the color of the supporting design. When in doubt, please use the default charcoal color supplied above.

## Our name

Whether you’re talking about the project as a whole or one of our products or innovations, you should only ever use “Mozilla” to refer to the organization. In general, the name doesn’t have to appear directly in front our product names (i.e. Mozilla Firefox), but should be prominent somewhere in the design or text you’re creating (preferably on first mention or using something like Tabzilla). If you are going to use a construction like “Mozilla Firefox,” only use it to refer to official, Mozilla-created products.

## A note on the dino

The classic Mozilla dino head logo served as a symbol of the organization since our earliest days, but is now reserved for select uses and executions only. While you may still see it pop up on certain sites and campaigns, please use the Mozilla wordmark on all properties and materials instead.
